This is my  fifth project of the Udacity Front-end developer nanodegree. To complete this project, I have been using following.

* Javasctipt
* Javscript OO
* HTML 5 (Element Errors due to KO)
* CSS 3 (validated)
* CSS Media query
* knockout.js
* Google Maps API ( async)
* AJAX
* Newyork times API
* Wikipedia API ( )
* Street view API
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

* Gulp

### new version
The difference with the first version are

* 6 different hard coded locations, You can select/unselect or add new location
* button to show/hide the list of locations that user can select/unselect or remove
* button to display the list of categories that user can select/unselect filter 
* list of locations ( hidden by default)

* In addition to look for places categories nearby locations, the search box can be used to add a new location via to Google Maps searchbox. 
* To add  a new location, you must prefix your desired location with a double colon :  ( as for instance :NewYork central park or a full address)



###Setting up Project:

The Readable and commented HTML/CSS/JavaScript files are in the '<project folder>/src' folder. Gulp is used to minify html, javasript and css files , to cmpress images, and to deploy the resulting files into the <project folder>. Check ['src'](https://github.com/PaulMatencio/Neighbourhood-map-5.1-Project/tree/master/src) folder for commented readable codes.

###Project Overview:

Develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood you would like to visit. Add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

###How to use the app

* SEARCH BOX ( filter for google Maps categories or add a new Location)

  Use the search box to find nearby places ( cafe, restaurant, movie , atm , shopping) of locations. You can type multiple place types must be separated by blan. There are 6 hard coded locations of Paris. When you type categories in the serach box, the application will look for nearby places around all the current locations.

  Looking for nearby places are handled by the application. However, the application will call Google maps nearby search services, therefore keyword must matched Google Maps place types. Some filter to map keyword to Google Place types are attempted. Further mapping must be done. You can also use the question mark at the end of the Search box to show the list of google applicable categories.

  To add a new  location, type :new-location as for instance :London picadelly square or :Newyork central park or any full address. 
  When a new location is entered, the application will use the Google maps searchBox services to look ONLY for coordinates ( textsearch services could be used instead), it will not use the nearby places returned by Google Search box. The coordinated returmed by search-box are used to mark the location and by the nearby search services to look for nearby places. 

  Places returned by nearby places services  are used to display the Place list and to make google maps markers.

* BUTTONS

  There are 3 buttons after the SEARCH BOX

  The first one is to display the list of Locations.

  The second one can be used to filter multiple categories ( place types)

  The third one is to refresh the list of categories ( place types). 


* LOCATION LIST ( Location filter)

  There are 5 hard coded locations, 4 are selected by default.

  To select/unselect a location you must click on the label of that location. Checing/unchecking is not enough.
  To add a new location, use the SEARCH BOX ( type in the new location prefixed by a double colon :. The new location will be placed on top of the existing list of locations.
  To delete a new location, click on the remove button on the right of the location label. This button is shown when user pass the mouse over the label.

  When user unselect a location, all markers (map) and places (list view) of that location will be hidden. When a location is selected, markers and places will be displayed again.


* PLACES LIST VIEW:

   The place list viewis on the right, you can find the places corresponding to the markers. Clicking on one place will focus the map on the place and will open an info window. Every place contain a refence to its marker.

   When a info window is opened, the center of the map will slide, and depending on the size if the screen, the Places List can be hidden. The Places list can be shown as described below

   You can use the hamburger button located at top-right of your application window to  hide or show the Places list when the screen is small. It can be useful for devices with small screen.

   Places ( and markers) are moved whena location is unchecked. When all locations are unchecked or deleted, the list of places ( and the tool bars) will be hidden.

* HAMBURGER BUTTON:

  This button is at the top-rigth of the Place list. This button is hidden on large screen.

  You can use this button to hide or show the Placse list and the Button toolbar if the number of places are > 0
  Clicking on this button while the list of places is empty has no effect.

* TOOLBAR ( filter place categories)

   This toolbar dynamically changes with the neighborhood. It will show the set of the markers returned be the near by search or searchbox. The number of icons is limited to 9, use the search-box to filter other google Maps categories

   If you press one of the icon, it will re-request the search in the area with different category setting. These filters will be reused when you move into a new location. When your re-load your application, these filters will be reused to filter the categories of your new location.

   For example if you have a coffee icon it will return the 10-20 most popular coffee-shop of all your current locations.

   If you move into a new location, the application will use these categories to filter the nearbysearch.

   Important: You can reset the search with the refresh button. This will clear the category filters ( both memory and local storage copies) and return the 10-20 most popular places in the area. Äœoogle Maps may

  The listview and tool bars are hidden when user click on a marker. Use the hambuger menu on the top right corner to display them back.
